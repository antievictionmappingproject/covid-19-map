# COVID-19 Emergency Tenants Protections Map

Mapping states, counties, and municipalities that are enacting emergency tenant protections due to COVID-19 (the novel corona virus) pandemic, as well as where organized rent strikes are taking place.

## Data Source

Data sourcing and maintenance is being provided by the [Anti-Eviction Mapping Project](https://www.antievictionmap.com/).

**DISCLAIMER:** This data is by no means perfect or exhaustive of all emergency tenant protection policies. It has been crowdsourced and is maintained by a team of dedicated volunteers. If you notice something missing or incorrect in the data, please [reach out to us](mailto:antievictionmap@riseup.net) to let us know so we may update it accordingly! The AEMP recognizes that we are mapping Indigenous lands that have been stolen, colonized, divided, and renamed. We have depicted colonial and nation-state geographies because tenant protection legislation exists within these borders. Our goal is to pay our respect to the original stewards of the land by using Indigenous names, whenever a third-part service that we depend on allows us to implement this modification.

## Developer Instructions

Getting this project running locally requires that:

1. You are comfortable running programs on the [CLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) such as the [Terminal](https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/welcome/mac) program on MacOS.

2. You have installed [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) >= `v10.13` and either the [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) >= `1.22` or [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) >= `6.4` (NPM should automatically be installed with NodeJS). Older versions of any of these may or may not work.

### Develop

First, in the root level of this repo install the required package dependencies by doing:

```
yarn install
```

or

```
npm install
```

To start a local web server with live reload do:

```
yarn start
```

or

```
npm start
```

Then visit `localhost:8080` in your browser.

---

To create a production optimized build that will be outputted in the `dist` directory do:

```
yarn build
```

or

```
npm run build
```

To view the productionized site / bundle, use the `start:prod` script.  
(see the [Deploying](#deploying) section below).

### Deploying

To deploy the site to Github Pages on the `gh-pages` branch (this will also run the `build` script above prior to publishing) do:

```
yarn deploy
```

or

```
npm run deploy
```

You will need to have write privileges to this repository on Github to be able to do this.

**NOTE: Use caution when doing this**, _before deploying you should make sure your build is successful and runs as expected. You may do this by running the script `start:prod` which will create a production build then start a local server in the dist directory._

Assuming you have already run the `build` script, you may view the site using the output / bundled files from Webpack by doing:

```
yarn start:prod
```

or

```
npm run start:prod
```

You may now view the site on `http://localhost:5000`

### Translations

To add translations:

1. Copy the file `src/locale/en.json`
2. Rename the file to using the [IETF language tag standard](https://gist.github.com/traysr/2001377) followed by `.json`. For example: `de.json`
3. Replace the existing text with the translated text.

- Do not change the keys. For example `{"do-not-change": "This text should be changed"}`

**Optional: implement the translation**
If you're comfortable with javascript, you can also add the language to the i18n configuration.

4. Add the language code to the value of `languages` in the file `src/utils/constants.js`. For example: `const languages = ['en', 'pt-BR', 'es-MX']`
5. Add the following to the file `src/locale/index.js`, substituting `de` for the language code you are working with:

```js
// In imports
import de from './de.json'

// Inside of the exported object
de: {
  translation: de,
},
```

6. To validate that you have all the correct keys in your language file:

- Add your locale to the test file, `locale/locale.test.js`, by importing at the top of the file, and adding it to the `translations` object.
- Run `npm run test`. If there are any missing or extra keys, you will see an error which informs you which key and language is the issue.

7. To check that your new language works, run the development environment, and add `?lang=<your-lang>` to the url. Make sure that all the expected text is displayed as expected.
