    "warning": "We know that evictions are happening despite protections, and that many protections have expired. Please fill out our survey on the map to add information about evictions where you live. You can also use the map to find legal aid and community organizers in your area. If you are experiencing eviction or landlord harassment, you can also fill out our <a href='https://airtable.com/shrHbY2q4ZmFtkB9d' target='_blank rel='noreferrer noopener'>survey here</a>.",

      "paragraph-1": "This map is an emergency response project to present COVID-19 global housing legislation and housing justice action information. It is by the Anti-Eviction Mapping Project, a data-visualization, data analysis, and storytelling collective with chapters primarily in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York as well as collaborators worldwide.",
      "paragraph-2": "The Anti-Eviction Mapping Project aggregates data using free and open-source technologies to support social movements, community organizations, and research groups working toward housing justice. Data is crowd-sourced and by no means perfectly or exhaustively. For more info. on our data collection, sharing, and privacy, see <a href='https://antievictionmap.com/data-use-agreement' target='_blank rel='noreferrer noopener'>here</a>.",
      "paragraph-3": "To learn more about our US housing protection scoring methodology, see here. To view a table of the data itself, see <a href='#' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>here</a>",
      "paragraph-4": "The Anti-Eviction Mapping Project recognizes that we are mapping Indigenous lands that have been stolen, colonized, divided, and renamed. Colonial and nation-state are depicted because tenant protection legislation exists within these borders. Our goal is to pay our respect to the original stewards of the land by using Indigenous names whenever a limitation from a third-party service that we depend allows us to implement this modification.",
      "paragraph-5": "While the Anti-Eviction Mapping Project maintains close relationships with a number of tenant organizations and networks, this development of this map has in particular relied upon collaboration with the <a href='https://mappingaction.org/' target='_blank rel='noreferrer noopener'>Mapping Action Collective</a>, <a href='http://www.tenantstogether.org/' target='_blank rel='noreferrer noopener'>Tenants Together</a>, the <a href='http://sfadc.org/landingpage/covid-19/' target='_blank rel='noreferrer noopener'>San Francisco Anti-Displacement Coalition</a>,  <a href='https://ebho.org/' target='_blank rel='noreferrer noopener'>East Bay Housing Organizations</a>, <a href='http://communityjusticeproject.com/' target='_blank rel='noreferrer noopener'>Community Justice Project</a>, <a href='https://www.law.columbia.edu/faculty/emily-benfer' target='_blank rel='noreferrer noopener'>Dr. Emily Benfer</a> and <a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/e/2PACX-1vTH8dUIbfnt3X52TrY3dEHQCAm60e5nqo0Rn1rNCf15dPGeXxM9QN9UdxUfEjxwvfTKzbCbZxJMdR7X/pubhtml?gid=1277129435&single=true&urp=gmail_link' target='_blank rel='noreferrer noopener'>her law students</a>, and <a href='https://bayarearentstrike.org/' target='_blank rel='noreferrer noopener'>Bay Area Rent Strike (BARS)</a> organizers, as well as assistance in international research from our friends at <a href='https://notanatlas.org/about/' target='_blank rel='noreferrer noopener'>kollektiv orangotango</a> and the <a href='https://housingnotprofit.org/' target='_blank rel='noreferrer noopener'>European Action Coalition for the Right to Housing</a>.
