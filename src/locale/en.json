    "warning": "We know that evictions are happening despite protections, and that many protections have expired. Please fill out our survey on the map to add information about evictions where you live. You can also use the map to find legal aid and community organizers in your area.",

      "paragraph-1": "This map is an emergency response project to present COVID-19 global housing legislation and housing justice action information. It is by the Anti-Eviction Mapping Project, a data-visualization, data analysis, and storytelling collective with chapters primarily in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York as well as collaborators worldwide.",
      "paragraph-2": "The Anti-Eviction Mapping Project aggregates data using free and open-source technologies to support social movements, community organizations, and research groups working toward housing justice. Data is crowd-sourced and by no means perfectly or exhaustively. For more information on our data collection, sharing, and privacy, see <a href='#' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>here</a>.",
      "paragraph-3": "To learn more about our US housing protection scoring methodology, see here. To view a table of the data itself, see <a href='#' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>here</a>",
      "paragraph-4": "The Anti-Eviction Mapping Project recognizes that we are mapping Indigenous lands that have been stolen, colonized, divided, and renamed. Colonial and nation-state are depicted because tenant protection legislation exists within these borders. Our goal is to pay our respect to the original stewards of the land by using Indigenous names whenever a limitation from a third-party service that we depend allows us to implement this modification.",
      "paragraph-5": "While the Anti-Eviction Mapping Project maintains close relationships with a number of tenant organizations and networks, this development of this map has in particular relied upon collaboration with the Mapping Action Collective, Tenants Together, the San Francisco Anti-Displacement Coalition,  East Bay Housing Organizations, Community Justice Project, Dr. Emily Benfer and her law students, and Bay Area Rent Strike (BARS) organizers, as well as assistance in international research from our friends at kollektiv orangotango and the European Action Coalition for the Right to Housing. We are grateful for consultation from Right To The City Alliance, Policy Link, Dr. Lisa Bates, and John Pollock from Public Justice, Greg Townley from the Homelessness Research Action Collaborative, and Leeor Schwitzer from Portland Tenants United."
