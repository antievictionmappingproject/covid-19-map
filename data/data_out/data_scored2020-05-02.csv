No-fault evictions of a residential tenant, except when necessary for the health and safety of tenants, neighbors, or the landlord. To gain these critical tenant protections, Berkeley tenants who suffer Coronavirus-related income disruption must, in writing, notify their landlords of their income disruption, and resultant inability to pay rent. Further, the tenant must attach documentation of their income disruption or COVID-19 out-of-pocket medical expense, such as a medical bill, paystubs, or letter from an employer indicating that the tenant has suffered reduced hours or lost wages due to the Coronavirus.  Where a landlord knows that a tenant cannot pay all or some of their rent due to the Coronavirus, the Berkeley COVID-19 Emergency Response Ordinance also prohibits landlords from serving notices to pay rent or quit, initiating a related eviction action in court, or prosecuting said eviction action.

The order only bars police from enforcing evictions due to nonpayment of rent for a period of ninety days, but evictions for failing a rental inspection, noise complaints or any other thing deemed as a lease violation may still be served. The order makes no space for a longer repayment schedule while numerous banks have publicly given 12-month extensions to their mortgage holders, nor does this order address the need for a Nationwide Rent Freeze or Suspension to keep out of work renters from accruing mass amounts of debt.",NA,https://www.oregon.gov/gov/Documents/executive_orders/eo_20-13.pdf,Yes,Existing tenant protection,Yes,Oregon,State // Estado,Oregon,NA,NA,NA,Yes,Moratorium (landlords are not allowed to serve notices to tenants),Evictions for non-payment of rent related to COVID-19,Yes,As soon as reasonably possible,Not specified,Yes,When they notify their landlord,Tenants must pay as much of the rent as possible,"No, they can't charge late fees or interest",Nothing,Yes,2020-04-01T00:00:00Z,2020-06-30T00:00:00Z,"No, but I want to share something about court process / law enforcement policies",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2020-03-22T00:00:00Z,2020-06-30T00:00:00Z,I don't know,I don't know,No,"In addition to rent, tenants are protected from eviction for not paying late fees, utility charges, or any other charges.

The Governor's order also prohibits charging late fees. Most counties and some cities have also limited the eviction moratorium to non-payment cases, and a few have extended it to no-cause evictions. Under the Chief Judge's order, while hearings and proceedings for civil cases are generally postponed, the cases with statutory or constitutional mandates requiring them to be held during the moratorium period will still continue.
